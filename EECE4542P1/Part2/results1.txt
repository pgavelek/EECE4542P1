The exhaustive algorithm used for the graph coloring has an exponential complexity. It recurses a process of complexity equivalent to O(n^4) and overall as a complexity equivalent to O(k^n) where k is the number of colors to be used. Clearly from the results this kind of algorithm is only effective for very small inputs like the 12 node, 4 color example since the next one after that could not be completed after running the algorithm on a computer for 10 minutes. Its performance for more complex examples that followed only got progressively worse, showing in practice how ineffective a brute force heuristic is to solving this kind of problem.
